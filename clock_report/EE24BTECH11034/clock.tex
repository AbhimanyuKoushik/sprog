\section{Introduction and Project Overview}
The digital clock project represents a complete embedded system implementation that showcases multiple fundamental engineering principles in practical application. This implementation goes beyond basic timekeeping to deliver a versatile timing device with three fully functional operational modes, each with distinct characteristics and requirements.

The standard clock mode maintains accurate 24-hour timekeeping with hours, minutes, and seconds display. This mode implements automatic time progression with proper rollover handling at 23:59:59, and includes user-adjustable time setting capability. The time adjustment functionality incorporates intelligent reset behavior where seconds are automatically zeroed when hours or minutes are modified, ensuring precise time setting.

The stopwatch mode provides cumulative time measurement with start/stop control. This mode features independent time storage that continues counting upward from the last stopped position when restarted. The implementation handles all rollover cases correctly, maintaining accuracy up to 23:59:59 before resetting, with potential for extension to include lap timing functionality.

The countdown timer mode allows preset duration timing with automatic stop at zero. This mode incorporates configurable initial values for hours, minutes, and seconds, with intelligent countdown sequencing that properly handles borrow operations across time units. The timer includes visual indication upon reaching zero, with potential for audible alert addition.
