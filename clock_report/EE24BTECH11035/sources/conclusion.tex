This project successfully implements a digital clock using an ATmega328P microcontroller, seven-segment displays, and a 7447 BCD to 7-segment decoder. The clock accurately displays time in the HH:MM:SS format by utilizing a hardware timer interrupt for precise timekeeping.

Key takeaways from this project include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Efficient multiplexing: Controlling multiple 7-segment displays using limited I/O pins.
    \item Precise timing: Achieved using Timer1 interrupt to increment seconds every second.
    \item BCD-based storage: Ensuring correct representation of time without complex conversions.
    \item Modularity and expandability: The system can be modified for real-time clock (RTC) modules or additional features like alarms.
\end{itemize}

This project demonstrates how microcontrollers can be used for real-time applications, providing a foundation for more advanced embedded systems. Future improvements may include RTC integration, battery backup, or OLED/LCD display support for enhanced functionality.
