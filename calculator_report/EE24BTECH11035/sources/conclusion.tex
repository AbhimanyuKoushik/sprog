This project successfully implements a scientific calculator for the AVR microcontroller, allowing users to input expressions via buttons and view results on an LCD display. The key features include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Support for basic arithmetic and advanced mathematical functions.
\item A recursive descent parser for accurate expression evaluation.
\item Custom approximations for trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions.
\end{itemize}

Future enhancements could include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Improving numerical accuracy by increasing iterations in Taylor series expansions.
\item Expanding functionality to include additional mathematical functions.
\item Optimizing memory usage for improved performance on low-memory microcontrollers.
\end{itemize}
