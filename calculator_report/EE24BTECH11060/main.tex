This project develops a scientific calculator using an Arduino UNO, a 16x2 LCD display, and push buttons. It supports arithmetic, trigonometric, and logarithmic operations with real-time computation and display. The system ensures accuracy using floating-point arithmetic and efficient input handling. Challenges like input management and display optimization were addressed to enhance usability. Future enhancements may include a touchscreen interface, additional functions, and memory storage.


\section{Introduction}
A scientific calculator is an essential tool for performing mathematical computations. This project focuses on implementing a calculator using an Arduino UNO that supports basic arithmetic, trigonometric, and logarithmic functions. The system uses a button-based input mechanism and an LCD for output display.
\section{Hardware Components}
\begin{itemize}
\item Arduino UNO
\item 16x2 LCD Display
\item Push Buttons
\item Breadboard 
\item Jumper Wires
\item Power Supply
\item Resistors (1k$\Omega$ ,15k$\Omega$,2k$\Omega$)
\end{itemize}
\section{Circuit Connections}
The connections for the components are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Connect 5V and Ground from the Arduino onto the breadboard.
    \item Connect the push buttons in 2 rows (each from grid to power lines not connected to Ground or 5V). The first row must have 10 buttons (for digits), and the second row must have 13 buttons (for functions). Connect one terminal of each button to Ground.

\section{Software Implementation}
The Arduino code reads button inputs, processes mathematical operations, and displays the results on the LCD. The program initializes the LCD, manages user input, and executes the required functions using mathematical libraries. The key features of the software implementation include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reading input from push buttons and mapping them to corresponding mathematical functions.
\item Displaying user inputs and results dynamically on the LCD.
\item Performing calculations using predefined mathematical functions in Arduino's library.
\item Handling errors such as invalid inputs or operations.
\item Implementing a real-time response mechanism to ensure smooth functionality.
\item Allowing easy modification of the code to add more functions in the future.
\end{itemize}
\section{Working Principle}
\begin{itemize}
\item The push buttons send signals to the Arduino, which interprets the input and processes the mathematical operations.
\item The LCD module displays the entered values and computed results.
\item The calculator follows a sequential operation mechanism where expressions are evaluated as they are entered.
\item Predefined mathematical functions such as trigonometric and logarithmic calculations are executed using Arduino libraries.
\item The system ensures accuracy by using floating-point arithmetic for precise calculations.
\item Error handling mechanisms prevent invalid inputs from disrupting calculations.
\end{itemize}
